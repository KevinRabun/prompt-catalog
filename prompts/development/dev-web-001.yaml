prompt: |
  You are a senior web developer implementing a web application feature.

  **Context:**
  - Feature: {{feature_description}}
  - Frontend Framework: {{frontend_framework}}
  - Backend Framework: {{backend_framework}}
  - Database: {{database}}
  - Authentication: {{auth_method}}

  **Implement the feature following this structure:**

  ### 1. Backend Implementation
  - **API Endpoints**: Define RESTful routes with proper HTTP methods
  - **Input Validation**: Validate all request parameters and body fields
  - **Business Logic**: Implement in a service/use-case layer (not in controllers)
  - **Data Access**: Use repository pattern with parameterized queries
  - **Error Handling**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes with consistent error format
  - **Authentication/Authorization**: Enforce on every protected endpoint
  - **Logging**: Log operations at appropriate levels

  ### 2. Frontend Implementation
  - **Component Structure**: Break UI into small, reusable components
  - **State Management**: Use appropriate state management for the data scope
  - **API Integration**: Centralized API client with error handling
  - **Loading States**: Show loading, error, and empty states for async operations
  - **Form Handling**: Client-side validation + server-side validation
  - **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
  - **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, test across breakpoints

  ### 3. Integration
  - API contract between frontend and backend
  - Error propagation from backend to user-facing messages
  - Authentication token handling
  - CORS configuration

  ### 4. Testing
  - Backend: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints
  - Frontend: Component tests, integration tests for user flows

  **Code Quality Requirements:**
  - TypeScript / type safety where applicable
  - No `any` types (TypeScript) — use proper interfaces
  - Consistent error handling pattern throughout
  - Environment-specific configuration via environment variables
  - No hard-coded URLs, secrets, or environment-specific values

  **Security Requirements:**
  - Validate all inputs server-side (client validation is UX only)
  - Parameterized database queries
  - Output encoding for user-generated content
  - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
  - Secure cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
  - Rate limiting on authentication and public endpoints

  **Important:**
  - Verify that APIs and methods you use exist in the specified framework version
  - Include inline comments for non-obvious logic
  - Handle edge cases (empty data, network errors, concurrent modifications)
  - If suggesting a library, verify it's actively maintained and compatible

    examples: ["JWT", "Session-based", "OAuth 2.0 / OIDC", "API keys"]

expected_output: "Production-ready code for frontend and backend with proper error handling, validation, testing, and security"

quality_criteria:
  - "API follows RESTful conventions with proper status codes"
  - "All inputs are validated server-side"
  - "Error handling is consistent and informative"
  - "UI handles loading, error, and empty states"
  - "Code is typed and follows framework conventions"
  - "Tests cover happy path and error scenarios"

anti_patterns:
  - "Business logic in controllers/route handlers"
  - "No input validation on the server"
  - "Generic catch-all error handling"
  - "UI with no loading or error states"
  - "Hard-coded values instead of configuration"
