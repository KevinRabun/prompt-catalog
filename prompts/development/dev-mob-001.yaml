prompt: |
  You are a mobile developer implementing a feature for a mobile application.

  **Context:**
  - Feature: {{feature_description}}
  - Platform: {{target_platform}}
  - Framework: {{mobile_framework}}
  - Backend API: {{backend_api}}
  - Minimum OS Version: {{min_os_version}}

  **Implement the feature covering:**

  ### 1. Architecture
  - Follow {{target_platform}}'s recommended architecture pattern
  - Separate UI, business logic, and data layers
  - Use dependency injection for testability
  - Implement proper navigation/routing

  ### 2. UI Implementation
  - Follow platform design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS)
  - Support different screen sizes and orientations
  - Implement proper keyboard handling
  - Handle safe areas and notches/islands
  - Support dark mode
  - Implement loading, error, and empty states
  - Support accessibility (VoiceOver/TalkBack, Dynamic Type/Font Scaling)

  ### 3. Data Layer
  - API client with proper error handling and retry logic
  - Offline support strategy (if applicable)
  - Local storage for cached/persistent data
  - Data synchronization between local and remote
  - Handle network connectivity changes gracefully

  ### 4. Platform Integration
  - Handle app lifecycle events (foreground, background, terminate)
  - Request permissions at point of use with clear explanation
  - Handle permission denial gracefully
  - Deep link / universal link support (if applicable)
  - Push notification handling (if applicable)

  ### 5. Performance
  - Minimize main thread work (especially UI rendering)
  - Efficient list/grid rendering with item recycling
  - Image loading with caching and placeholder
  - Minimize app startup time
  - Reduce battery consumption

  ### 6. Security
  - Secure credential storage (Keychain/Keystore)
  - Certificate pinning for API communication
  - Biometric authentication (if applicable)
  - Code obfuscation for release builds
  - Never store secrets in the app binary

  ### 7. Testing
  - Unit tests for business logic
  - Widget/UI component tests
  - Integration tests for critical flows
  - Test on multiple device sizes and OS versions

  **Important:**
  - Verify API compatibility with the minimum OS version specified
  - Follow platform-specific naming conventions and patterns
  - Handle device-specific behaviors (Android fragmentation, iOS version differences)
  - If using cross-platform, note where platform-specific code is needed

  - "Follows platform design guidelines"
  - "Handles lifecycle events properly"
  - "Supports accessibility features"
  - "Handles offline/error states gracefully"
  - "Security best practices followed"
  - "Tests cover critical paths"

anti_patterns:
  - "Business logic in UI components"
  - "No offline or error handling"
  - "Ignoring accessibility"
  - "Blocking the main thread"
  - "Storing secrets in app bundle"
