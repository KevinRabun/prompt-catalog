  You are a project manager helping to define the scope of a software project.

  **Project Context:**
  - Project Name: {{project_name}}
  - Business Objective: {{business_objective}}
  - Timeline: {{timeline}}
  - Budget Constraints: {{budget_constraints}}
  - Team Size: {{team_size}}

  **Create a scope document covering:**

  ### 1. Project Vision
  - One-paragraph vision statement
  - Key success metrics (how will we know this project succeeded?)

  ### 2. In Scope (MVP / Phase 1)
  - List features and capabilities included in the initial release
  - Prioritize using MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
  - Identify the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) — the smallest useful release

  ### 3. Explicitly Out of Scope
  - List features or capabilities deliberately excluded
  - Explain WHY each is out of scope (timeline, budget, complexity, dependency)
  - Note which out-of-scope items may be addressed in future phases

  ### 4. Constraints
  - Technical constraints (existing systems, mandated technologies)
  - Business constraints (budget, timeline, regulatory)
  - Resource constraints (team skills, availability)
  - Organizational constraints (approval processes, governance)

  ### 5. Assumptions
  - List all assumptions the scope is based on
  - Identify the risk if each assumption is wrong

  ### 6. Dependencies
  - External dependencies (third-party systems, APIs, vendors)
  - Internal dependencies (other teams, infrastructure, approvals)

  ### 7. Risks
  - Top risks to scope delivery
  - Impact and likelihood assessment
  - Mitigation strategies

  ### 8. Phase Plan (if multi-phase)
  - Phase 1 (MVP): [scope]
  - Phase 2: [scope]
  - Phase 3+: [scope]

  **Important:**
  - Be realistic about what can be achieved in the timeline
  - A smaller scope delivered well is better than an ambitious scope delivered poorly
  - Flag scope items that need further research before commitment
  - Ask clarifying questions about priorities and constraints

variables:
  - name: "project_name"
    description: "Name of the project"
    required: true
  - name: "business_objective"
    description: "The business problem this project solves"
    required: true
    examples: ["Reduce order processing time by 50%", "Enable self-service account management for customers"]
  - name: "timeline"
    description: "Available timeline for delivery"
    required: true
    examples: ["3 months to MVP", "6 months for full release", "2 sprints for Phase 1"]
  - name: "budget_constraints"
    description: "Budget limitations"
    required: false
    default: "To be determined"
    examples: ["$50K development budget", "2 FTE engineers for 3 months"]
  - name: "team_size"
    description: "Available team members and their roles"
    required: false
    default: "To be determined"
    examples: ["2 backend, 1 frontend, 1 QA", "3 full-stack developers"]

expected_output: "A comprehensive scope document with clear in/out-of-scope boundaries, constraints, assumptions, and risk assessment"

quality_criteria:
  - "MVP is clearly defined and achievable"
  - "Out-of-scope items are explicit with rationale"
  - "All assumptions are documented"
  - "Risks have mitigation strategies"
  - "Scope aligns with stated constraints"

anti_patterns:
  - "Scope that exceeds available resources"
  - "No explicit out-of-scope section"
  - "Undocumented assumptions"
  - "Missing risk assessment"
