prompt: |
  You are a software architect designing a human resources information system (HRIS).

  **Context:**
  - Organization Scope: {{organization_scope}}
  - HR Modules Required: {{hr_modules}}
  - Payroll Requirements: {{payroll_requirements}}
  - Compliance Jurisdictions: {{compliance_jurisdictions}}
  - Integration Requirements: {{integration_requirements}}

  **Design and implement covering these HR-specific requirements:**

  ### 1. Employee Lifecycle Management
  - **Pre-boarding**: offer letter generation, background check integration, new-hire paperwork
  - **Onboarding**: task checklists, training assignments, equipment provisioning, buddy assignment
  - **Active employment**: position, department, manager, compensation, and status changes
  - **Transfers and promotions**: workflow for internal moves with effective dating
  - **Leave of absence**: FMLA, ADA, parental, military, personal with return tracking
  - **Separation**: voluntary/involuntary termination workflows, exit interviews, asset recovery
  - **Rehire**: retain historical data, streamlined re-onboarding
  - **Effective dating**: all employment changes recorded with effective dates for historical accuracy
  - **Org chart**: dynamic visualization of reporting relationships, span of control

  ### 2. Compensation and Payroll
  - **Compensation structures**: salary grades, bands, step increases, geographic differentials
  - **Payroll calculation engine**:
    - Gross-to-net with federal, state, and local tax withholding
    - Pre-tax and post-tax deductions (health, dental, vision, 401k, HSA, FSA)
    - Garnishments and court-ordered deductions with priority rules
    - Overtime calculation per FLSA rules (and state-specific variations)
    - Retroactive adjustments and off-cycle payments
  - **Tax engine**: W-4 processing, multi-state taxation, reciprocity agreements
  - **Year-end processing**: W-2, 1099, ACA reporting (1095-B/C)
  - **Direct deposit**: ACH file generation, pay card support
  - **Pay equity analysis**: tools to identify and flag compensation disparities
  - **Payroll journal**: export to GL with configurable account mapping
  - **DECIMAL TYPES**: Use decimal (never float) for all monetary calculations

  ### 3. Benefits Administration
  - **Open enrollment**: annual enrollment workflows with plan comparison tools
  - **Life event processing**: qualifying events (marriage, birth, loss of coverage) with eligibility rules
  - **Plan configuration**: medical, dental, vision, life, disability, FSA, HSA, 401k
  - **Eligibility engine**: rules-based eligibility (employment class, hours, waiting periods)
  - **Carrier feeds**: EDI 834 files for benefit carrier enrollment synchronization
  - **COBRA administration**: qualifying event tracking, notification, payment management
  - **ACA compliance**: variable-hour tracking, measurement/stability periods, affordability
  - **Dependent management**: add/remove dependents with documentation requirements
  - **Cost modeling**: employer and employee contribution calculators

  ### 4. Time and Attendance
  - **Time capture**: web clock, mobile clock, physical terminal integration, timesheet entry
  - **Scheduling**: shift scheduling, rotation patterns, open shift management
  - **Pay rules engine**: overtime (daily, weekly, 7th day), shift differentials, holiday premiums
  - **Leave management**: PTO accrual rules, balance tracking, request/approval workflows
  - **Absence tracking**: unscheduled absence patterns, Bradford Factor, FMLA tracking
  - **Geofencing**: validate clock-in/out location for remote or field workers
  - **Meal and break compliance**: automated alerts for jurisdiction-specific break requirements
  - **Integration**: feed approved time to payroll with code mapping

  ### 5. Performance Management
  - **Goal setting**: cascading goals (company → department → individual), OKR support
  - **Review cycles**: configurable review periods (annual, semi-annual, quarterly, continuous)
  - **360-degree feedback**: multi-rater feedback with anonymity controls
  - **Competency frameworks**: role-based competency models with proficiency levels
  - **Calibration**: manager calibration sessions to normalize ratings across teams
  - **Performance improvement plans (PIP)**: structured improvement tracking with milestones
  - **Continuous feedback**: peer-to-peer recognition, real-time manager feedback
  - **Compensation linkage**: connect performance ratings to merit increase recommendations

  ### 6. Workforce Analytics and Reporting
  - **Headcount analytics**: real-time headcount by org, department, location, EEO category
  - **Turnover analysis**: voluntary/involuntary, regretted/non-regretted, trending
  - **Diversity metrics**: EEO-1' component 1 reporting, pay equity, representation metrics
  - **Compensation analytics**: total cost of workforce, comp ratio, range penetration
  - **Absence analytics**: absence rates, patterns, cost of absence
  - **Predictive analytics**: flight risk modeling, succession readiness, workforce planning
  - **Compliance reporting**: EEO-1, VETS-4212, AAP, ACA, state new-hire reporting
  - **Manager dashboards**: self-service team analytics for people managers
  - **Data privacy**: aggregate and anonymize analytics where individual identification not required

  ### 7. Employee Self-Service and Experience
  - **Personal information**: address, emergency contacts, tax withholding updates
  - **Pay**: pay stubs, W-2 access, direct deposit management
  - **Benefits**: enrollment, dependent changes, plan documents, ID cards
  - **Time off**: request PTO, view balances, team calendar
  - **Performance**: view goals, submit self-assessment, access reviews
  - **Learning**: assigned training, browse catalog, track completion
  - **Mobile app**: native mobile experience for common self-service tasks
  - **Digital assistant / chatbot**: answer common HR questions (with escalation to HR team)
  - **Notifications**: proactive alerts for tasks, deadlines, approvals

  ### 8. Compliance and Security
  - **Labor law compliance**: FLSA, FMLA, ADA, Title VII, ADEA, state/local labor laws
  - **Data privacy**: employee PII protection per GDPR (EU employees), CCPA, state privacy laws
  - **Access control**: role-based access (HR admin, manager, employee, benefits admin, payroll admin)
  - **Data segregation**: restrict access by org unit, location, country (critical for global orgs)
  - **Audit trail**: immutable log of all data changes with user, timestamp, old/new values
  - **Document retention**: per-jurisdiction retention schedules (I-9 = 3 years, payroll = 7 years, etc.)
  - **SOC 2 controls**: if SaaS, demonstrate security and availability controls
  - **SSO/MFA**: integrate with corporate identity provider, enforce MFA for sensitive operations

  **IMPORTANT CAVEATS:**
  - Payroll errors have direct employee impact and potential regulatory penalties — test exhaustively
  - Labor law and tax regulations vary by jurisdiction and change frequently — design for configurability
  - HR data is among the most sensitive in any organization — security is non-negotiable
  - Benefits eligibility rules are complex — engage benefits counsel for edge cases
  - International HR (if applicable) multiplies complexity — consider phased rollout by country

  **Deliver:**
  1. Employee lifecycle data model with effective dating
  2. Payroll calculation engine architecture with tax integration
  3. Benefits administration with eligibility engine and carrier integration
  4. Time and attendance with pay rules engine
  5. Performance management workflow design
  6. Compliance framework mapping (FLSA, FMLA, ACA, EEO, privacy)

expected_output: "Complete HRIS architecture with employee lifecycle management, payroll engine, benefits administration, compliance framework, and analytics"

quality_criteria:
  - "Payroll calculations use decimal types and match sample calculations exactly"
  - "Effective dating correctly handles past, present, and future-dated changes"
  - "Benefits eligibility engine handles all qualifying events and waiting periods"
  - "Compliance rules are configurable per jurisdiction without code changes"
  - "Access control enforces least-privilege with org-unit-level restrictions"
  - "Audit trail captures every data change with before/after values"

anti_patterns:
  - "Using floating-point arithmetic for payroll calculations"
  - "Hardcoding tax rates or labor law rules instead of making them configurable"
  - "No effective dating — overwriting employment history"
  - "Manager access to all employee data regardless of reporting relationship"
  - "Manual compliance reporting with no automated data collection"
  - "Storing SSNs or bank account numbers without encryption"
