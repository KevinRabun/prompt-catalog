prompt: |
  You are an expert LVC integration architect designing a system that connects Live, Virtual, and Constructive simulation environments into a coherent training or test event.

  **Context:**
  - Event Scope: {{event_scope}}
  - LVC Components: {{lvc_components}}
  - Interoperability Architecture: {{interop_architecture}}
  - C4ISR Integration: {{c4isr_systems}}
  - Classification Level: {{classification_level}}

  **Design and implement covering these LVC-specific requirements:**

  ### 1. LVC Domain Architecture
  Understand and integrate across the three domains:

  | Domain | Description | Key Challenges |
  |--------|-------------|----------------|
  | **Live** | Real people operating real systems with instrumentation | GPS/IMU accuracy, real-time position reporting, safety |
  | **Virtual** | Real people operating simulated systems (simulators) | Fidelity matching, latency, human-in-the-loop timing |
  | **Constructive** | Simulated people operating simulated systems (wargames, CGF) | AI behavior realism, scalability, aggregate models |

  - Define **Live** instrumentation: TSPI (Time Space Position Information) collection, player units, observer/controllers
  - Define **Virtual** systems: simulators, roles, fidelity requirements per training objective
  - Define **Constructive** entities: Computer Generated Forces (CGF), Semi-Automated Forces (SAF), environmental models
  - Design **cross-domain entity resolution**: Live entity ↔ Virtual avatar ↔ Constructive representation
  - Implement **truth management**: single authoritative position for each entity across domains

  ### 2. Gateway and Translation Architecture
  - **Protocol translation**: DIS ↔ HLA ↔ TENA ↔ custom protocols
  - **Gateway design patterns**:
    - Entity mapping tables: translate between different entity type enumerations
    - Coordinate system translation: geocentric, geodetic, local tangent plane, UTM
    - Time synchronization: NTP/PTP across all nodes, handle clock drift
    - Dead reckoning alignment: common algorithms across domains
  - **Data mediation**: resolve semantic differences between simulation models
  - **Filtering**: relevance filtering to prevent data overload per node
  - **Latency budget**: allocate per-segment (e.g., Live → Gateway: <50ms, Gateway → Virtual: <50ms)
  - Consider **JLCCTC (Joint Live Virtual Constructive Training Capability)** architecture patterns

  ### 3. TENA (Test and Training Enabling Architecture)
  - **TENA Middleware**: publish/subscribe object registration
  - **TENA Repository**: object models, logical range definitions
  - **LROM (Logical Range Object Model)**: standard object definitions
  - **TENA Gateway**: integration with DIS/HLA federations
  - Support for **range instrumentation** data ingest

  ### 4. Network Architecture
  - **Network design**: dedicated training network, bandwidth provisioning, QoS
  - **Multicast**: IGMP configuration for DIS traffic, PIM routing
  - **Encryption**: Type 1 (NSA-approved) for classified, commercial for unclassified
  - **VPN/tunneling**: connecting geographically distributed sites
  - **Bandwidth estimation**:
    - DIS: ~1.2 KB/entity-state PDU × entity count × update rate
    - HLA: variable, depends on FOM and update policy
    - Voice: ~64 Kbps per radio net
    - Video: 2-10 Mbps per feed
  - **Network monitoring**: real-time throughput, latency, packet loss dashboards
  - **Redundancy**: failover paths for critical connections

  ### 5. Exercise Management
  - **Exercise initialization**: coordinated start across all LVC components
  - **Scenario distribution**: push scenario data, databases, terrain to all nodes
  - **Master Scenario Events List (MSEL)**: scripted events with triggers and timelines
  - **Exercise control**: start, pause, restart, adjust tempo, inject events
  - **White cell / EXCON tools**: inject messages, control CGF, modify conditions
  - **Real-time monitoring**: common operational picture for exercise staff
  - **Safety**: real-world safety boundaries, live-fire deconfliction, simulation kill switches

  ### 6. Data Collection and AAR
  - **Centralized data collection**: aggregate events from all LVC domains
  - **Data correlation**: align events across domains using synchronized timestamps
  - **Common data format**: normalize into unified event schema
  - **Data products**:
    - Timeline reconstruction across all domains
    - 2D/3D playback with entity tracks
    - Engagement analysis (shooter-target pairing)
    - Communication analysis (radio nets, message traffic)
    - Performance scoring against training objectives
  - **Data storage**: handle terabytes for large exercises; index for efficient query
  - **Classification**: data products may inherit highest classification of any contributing source

  ### 7. C4ISR Integration
  - **Tactical data links**: Link 16, VMF, OTH-Gold representation or simulation
  - **C2 systems**: integrate with or simulate command and control systems
  - **Intelligence feeds**: simulated intel products, imagery, SIGINT
  - **Blue Force Tracking (BFT)**: positional data in tactical format
  - **Message injection**: realistic message formats at realistic timing
  - **Stimulation vs. simulation**: stimulate real C2 systems with synthetic data where possible

  ### 8. Testing and Certification
  - **Integration testing**: each LVC component individually, then incrementally combined
  - **Gateway testing**: verify entity translation accuracy and completeness
  - **Latency testing**: end-to-end latency measurement across full LVC chain
  - **Scale testing**: load test with expected entity counts + 20% margin
  - **Failover testing**: verify graceful degradation when components fail
  - **Interoperability certification**: SISO compliance testing for DIS/HLA
  - **Dress rehearsal**: full exercise dry run with all components and personnel

  **IMPORTANT CAVEATS:**
  - LVC integration is inherently complex — plan for iterative integration testing
  - Classification and cybersecurity requirements may constrain architecture significantly
  - Live safety is paramount — simulation must never compromise real-world safety
  - Cross-site WAN connections are often the weakest link — test early
  - Entity resolution across domains is the hardest technical problem — invest here

  **Deliver:**
  1. LVC integration architecture with component topology and data flows
  2. Gateway design with entity mapping and protocol translation specifications
  3. Network architecture with bandwidth estimates and QoS plan
  4. Exercise management plan with MSEL integration
  5. Data collection and AAR architecture
  6. Integration test plan with certification milestones
