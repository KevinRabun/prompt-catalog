  You are a software architect designing a legal technology application.

  **Context:**
  - Application Focus: {{application_focus}}
  - Legal Domain: {{legal_domain}}
  - User Types: {{user_types}}
  - Jurisdiction: {{jurisdiction}}
  - Data Sensitivity: {{data_sensitivity}}

  **Design and implement covering these legal-specific requirements:**

  ### 1. Matter and Case Management
  - **Matter structure**: hierarchical organization — client → matter → sub-matter → tasks
  - **Matter lifecycle**: intake, conflict check, opening, active, closing, closed, archived
  - **Conflict of interest checking**: automated cross-reference against existing clients and matters
  - **Task management**: assignments, deadlines, dependencies, time entries linked to tasks
  - **Calendar management**: court dates, filing deadlines, statute of limitations, discovery cutoffs
  - **Deadline calculation**: automatic computation from triggering events with jurisdiction-specific rules
  - **Correspondence tracking**: link all communications to matters (emails, letters, calls)
  - **Team management**: lead attorney, associates, paralegals, support staff per matter

  ### 2. Document Management (Legal-Specific)
  - **Document profiling**: metadata (matter, doc type, author, date, privilege status, confidentiality)
  - **Version control**: full version history with comparison and rollback
  - **Document assembly**: template-driven generation with matter data auto-population
  - **Naming conventions**: firm-standard naming with automated enforcement
  - **Ethical walls**: information barriers between matters to prevent conflicts
  - **Privilege tagging**: mark documents as privileged, work product, or confidential
  - **Hold management**: legal holds on documents for litigation preservation
  - **DMS integration**: iManage, NetDocuments, or custom repository
  - **Email integration**: file emails to matters with drag-and-drop or auto-filing rules

  ### 3. eDiscovery and Document Review
  - **Collection**: defensible collection from email, files, cloud storage, databases, mobile devices
  - **Processing**: de-duplication (exact + near-duplicate), format conversion, text extraction, OCR
  - **Review platform**: linear review, prioritized review, predictive coding / TAR (Technology Assisted Review)
  - **Coding panel**: responsive, not responsive, privileged, confidential, hot documents
  - **Quality control**: sampling, inter-reviewer agreement metrics, escalation workflows
  - **Production**: Bates stamping, redaction, production format (native, TIFF, PDF)
  - **Privilege log**: automated generation from privilege-tagged documents
  - **Cost management**: metrics on review rate, cost per document, accuracy
  - **EDRM (Electronic Discovery Reference Model)** compliance across the workflow

  ### 4. Legal Research and AI Integration
  - **Research integration**: APIs to Westlaw, LexisNexis, or equivalent legal databases
  - **Citation verification**: validate case citations are still good law (not overruled/reversed)
  - **AI-assisted research**: LLM-powered legal research with mandatory source citation
  - **AI guardrails for legal content**:
    - NEVER present AI-generated text as legal advice
    - ALL AI outputs must include citations to primary sources
    - Confidence scoring on AI research findings
    - Human attorney review required before any client-facing use
    - Disclose AI usage to clients per jurisdiction ethics rules
  - **Knowledge management**: internal precedent, memoranda, and know-how databases
  - **Brief analysis**: automated extraction of legal issues, holdings, and reasoning

  ### 5. Time, Billing, and Financial Management
  - **Time entry**: contemporaneous time capture with timer, manual entry, and narrative
  - **Billing guidelines compliance**: LEDES/UTBMS codes, client billing guideline enforcement
  - **Rate management**: standard rates, client-specific rates, blended rates, fee caps
  - **Invoice generation**: LEDES 1998B format, customizable invoice templates
  - **Trust/IOLTA accounting**: client trust fund management per jurisdiction bar rules
  - **Budget tracking**: matter budgets, phase budgets, variance analysis
  - **Accounts receivable**: aging, collection workflows, write-off approval
  - **eBilling integration**: submit to client eBilling platforms (Brightflag, CounselLink, etc.)

  ### 6. Compliance and Ethics
  - **Bar compliance**: CLE tracking, bar admission status, pro bono reporting
  - **Ethics rules engine**: jurisdiction-specific ethics rules for conflicts, communications, fees
  - **Regulatory calendars**: filing deadlines, compliance reporting dates
  - **Audit trail**: complete, immutable log of all actions (document access, changes, searches)
  - **Data retention**: per-jurisdiction and client-specific retention rules
  - **Cross-border discovery**: manage discovery obligations across jurisdictions (Hague Convention)
  - **Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA, and jurisdiction-specific privacy compliance for client data

  ### 7. Security (Heightened for Legal)
  - **Attorney-client privilege**: technical controls preventing unauthorized disclosure
  - **Ethical walls / information barriers**: automated enforcement with monitoring and alerting
  - **Client data segregation**: logical or physical separation per engagement requirements
  - **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, end-to-end for privileged communications
  - **Access control**: matter-level permissions, need-to-know enforcement
  - **Mobile security**: secure containers, remote wipe, offline access controls
  - **External sharing**: secure portals with access logging, expiration, watermarking
  - **Insider threat**: monitoring for bulk download, off-hours access, privilege escalation

  ### 8. Reporting and Analytics
  - **Matter dashboards**: status, budget, timeline, team utilization per matter
  - **Financial analytics**: realization rates, utilization, profitability by practice area
  - **Portfolio analytics**: client portfolio concentration, risk assessment
  - **Benchmarking**: compare performance metrics across practice areas and attorneys
  - **Regulatory reporting**: automated generation of required filings and disclosures
  - **Client reporting**: matter status reports, budget updates, activity summaries

  **IMPORTANT CAVEATS:**
  - Legal software handles highly privileged and confidential data — security is paramount
  - AI in legal contexts requires extraordinary guardrails against hallucination
  - Jurisdiction-specific rules vary significantly — design for configurability
  - Trust accounting errors can result in bar discipline — implement robust financial controls
  - Always consult practicing attorneys for legal workflow validation

  **Deliver:**
  1. Matter and case management architecture
  2. Document management system with privilege and ethical wall controls
  3. eDiscovery workflow per EDRM model
  4. AI integration design with legal-specific guardrails
  5. Time and billing architecture with LEDES/UTBMS compliance
  6. Security architecture addressing attorney-client privilege protection

expected_output: "Complete legal technology architecture with matter management, document controls, eDiscovery workflow, AI guardrails, and privilege protection"

quality_criteria:
  - "Attorney-client privilege protections are technically enforced"
  - "Ethical walls prevent cross-matter information leakage"
  - "AI outputs include mandatory citations and disclaimers"

  - "Trust accounting complies with bar association requirements"
  - "Audit trail is immutable and comprehensive"

anti_patterns:
  - "AI-generated legal content without attorney review gates"
  - "No conflict-of-interest check during matter intake"
  - "Ethical walls enforced by policy alone without technical controls"
  - "Storing privileged documents without tagging or access control"
  - "Generic billing without LEDES/UTBMS code compliance"
