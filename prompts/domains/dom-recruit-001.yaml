  You are a software architect designing a recruiting and talent acquisition platform.

  **Context:**
  - Organization Type: {{organization_type}}
  - Hiring Volume: {{hiring_volume}}
  - Recruiting Model: {{recruiting_model}}
  - Integration Requirements: {{integration_requirements}}
  - Compliance Requirements: {{compliance_requirements}}

  **Design and implement covering these recruiting-specific requirements:**

  ### 1. Job Requisition and Posting
  - **Requisition workflow**: create → approve → open → filled → closed
  - **Approval routing**: based on department, level, headcount plan, and budget
  - **Job description builder**: template-based with inclusive language analysis
  - **Multi-channel distribution**: company career site, job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor), social media
  - **Automated posting**: single create, distribute to configured channels with tracking links
  - **Posting analytics**: views, clicks, applications per channel, cost per applicant
  - **Internal job board**: post internally first (configurable posting rules and timelines)
  - **Referral management**: employee referral tracking with bonus eligibility rules
  - **Programmatic advertising**: budget-optimized job ad placement across platforms

  ### 2. Candidate Pipeline Management
  - **Application intake**: online application, resume upload, LinkedIn apply, quick apply
  - **Resume parsing**: extract name, contact, experience, education, skills from uploaded resumes
  - **Pipeline stages**: applied → screened → phone screen → interview → offer → hired (configurable)
  - **Kanban view**: visual pipeline per requisition with drag-and-drop stage advancement
  - **Source tracking**: attribute every candidate to originating source/campaign
  - **Candidate deduplication**: detect returning candidates and link to historical records
  - **Candidate relationship management (CRM)**: nurture passive candidates with talent pools
  - **Pipeline analytics**: time-in-stage, conversion rates, bottleneck identification
  - **Communication hub**: email/SMS templates, automated status updates, personalized outreach

  ### 3. Screening and Assessment
  - **Pre-screening questions**: knockout questions with auto-disposition
  - **Skills assessment integration**: HackerRank, Codility, TestGorilla, custom assessments
  - **AI-assisted screening**:
    - Resume matching against job requirements
    - **Bias mitigation**: blind resume review option (remove name, photo, demographics)
    - Regular bias audits on AI screening outcomes
    - Human override and review for all AI decisions
    - Transparency: notify candidates if AI is used in screening
  - **Video screening**: async video interviews with structured evaluation rubrics
  - **Background checks**: integration with checkr, Sterling, or equivalent providers
  - **Reference checks**: automated reference collection with structured questionnaires
  - **Assessment scorecards**: standardized evaluation criteria per role

  ### 4. Interview Management
  - **Interview scheduling**: self-scheduling links, interviewer calendar sync (Google, Outlook)
  - **Availability management**: interviewers set availability windows, automated conflict detection
  - **Panel coordination**: multi-interviewer scheduling with room/video link booking
  - **Interview types**: phone, video, onsite, technical, panel, group, case study
  - **Structured interviews**: question banks tied to competencies, scoring rubrics
  - **Interview scorecards**: post-interview evaluation with standardized criteria
  - **Interviewer training**: flag untrained interviewers, track certification status
  - **Candidate experience**: confirmation emails, directions/links, interviewer bios, prep materials
  - **Debrief workflow**: collect all scorecards, facilitate hiring committee decisions

  ### 5. Offer Management
  - **Offer generation**: template-based offers with compensation, benefits, start date, contingencies
  - **Compensation benchmarking**: suggest ranges based on role, level, location, market data
  - **Approval workflow**: offer approvals with escalation for above-range compensation
  - **Offer negotiation tracking**: track counteroffers, modifications, final terms
  - **E-signature**: integrated offer letter signing (DocuSign, Adobe Sign)
  - **Offer analytics**: acceptance rate, decline reasons, time-to-accept
  - **Pre-boarding handoff**: trigger onboarding workflows upon offer acceptance
  - **Competing offer intelligence**: track market positioning and loss reasons

  ### 6. Career Site and Candidate Experience
  - **Career site CMS**: branded career pages with content blocks, team spotlights, culture content
  - **Job search**: faceted search/filter by location, department, level, remote/hybrid/onsite
  - **SEO optimization**: structured data markup (JobPosting schema), fast page loads, mobile-first
  - **Application UX**: mobile-optimized, minimal required fields, save-and-resume
  - **Candidate portal**: track application status, upcoming interviews, messages
  - **Chatbot**: answer FAQs, guide through application, check status
  - **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all candidate-facing surfaces
  - **Analytics**: career site traffic, drop-off rates, search-to-apply conversion

  ### 7. Compliance and Bias Prevention
  - **EEO compliance**: voluntary self-identification (race, gender, veteran, disability)
  - **OFCCP**: affirmative action plan support, applicant flow analysis for federal contractors
  - **EEOC reporting**: disposition tracking, adverse impact analysis
  - **State and local requirements**: ban-the-box, salary history bans, pay transparency
  - **Data retention**: jurisdiction-specific retention schedules (1-5 years for applicant data)
  - **GDPR (if applicable)**: consent for data processing, right to erasure, data portability
  - **AI transparency**: comply with NYC Local Law 144, Illinois AIPA, EU AI Act requirements
  - **Audit reports**: adverse impact ratios, four-fifths rule analysis, selection rate comparisons
  - **Accommodations**: process for requesting and tracking interview accommodations

  ### 8. Analytics and Reporting
  - **Recruiting funnel**: end-to-end conversion metrics per requisition, department, recruiter
  - **Time-to-fill and time-to-hire**: from requisition opening to start date
  - **Source effectiveness**: applications, hires, and quality-of-hire per source
  - **Recruiter productivity**: requisitions per recruiter, pipeline velocity, offer rate
  - **Diversity analytics**: pipeline diversity at each stage, representation vs. goals
  - **Cost analytics**: cost-per-hire, cost-per-applicant, agency spend
  - **Quality of hire**: new-hire performance ratings, retention at 90/180/365 days
  - **Hiring manager satisfaction**: survey scores and feedback
  - **Benchmark dashboards**: compare metrics across departments, locations, and time periods

  **IMPORTANT CAVEATS:**
  - AI in recruiting is under increasing regulation — monitor and comply with emerging AI hiring laws
  - Bias can enter at any stage — design bias checkpoints throughout the pipeline
  - Candidate data is personal data — apply privacy principles throughout
  - Employment law varies dramatically by jurisdiction — design for configurable compliance rules
  - Candidate experience directly impacts employer brand — invest in the applicant journey

  **Deliver:**
  1. Requisition and job posting architecture with multi-channel distribution
  2. Candidate pipeline management with CRM capabilities
  3. Assessment and screening framework with AI bias mitigation
  4. Interview scheduling and evaluation system
  5. Compliance framework (EEO, OFCCP, privacy, AI transparency)
  6. Analytics and reporting dashboard design
