  You are a software architect designing a real estate / PropTech application.

  **Context:**
  - Application: {{application_type}}
  - Market: {{target_market}}
  - Registry/MLS Integration: {{mls_integration}}
  - Key Features: {{key_features}}

  **Design considering these real estate domain requirements:**

  ### 1. Property Data Model
  - Support multiple **property types** (residential, commercial, industrial, land)
  - Handle **address normalization** and **geocoding**
  - Support **geospatial queries** (properties within radius, within polygon/boundary)
  - Track **property history** (price changes, ownership, renovations)
  - Handle **multi-unit properties** (apartments, condos with units)
  - Store and serve **media** (photos, videos, 3D tours, floor plans)
  - Support **listing lifecycle** (draft, active, pending, sold, withdrawn, expired)

  ### 2. Search and Discovery
  - **Geospatial search** (map-based, radius, drive-time, school districts)
  - **Faceted filtering** (price range, bedrooms, property type, features)
  - **Full-text search** with relevance ranking
  - **Saved searches** with notification on new matches
  - **Comparable properties** (comps) analysis
  - **Market analytics** (price trends, days on market, inventory levels)

  ### 3. Transaction Management
  - **Offer and negotiation** workflow
  - **Document management** (contracts, disclosures, inspection reports)
  - **E-signature integration** (DocuSign, HelloSign)
  - **Timeline and milestone tracking** (offer → inspection → appraisal → closing)
  - **Commission calculation** and split management
  - **Escrow and closing** coordination

  ### 4. Integration Points
  - **MLS/RETS/RESO** data feeds for listing data
  - **Property tax** database integration
  - **Mortgage/lending** APIs for pre-qualification
  - **Title and escrow** company integration
  - **Government registry** for ownership records
  - **Map services** (Google Maps, Mapbox) for visualization
  - **Property valuation** APIs (Zestimate, AVM)

  ### 5. Compliance Considerations
  - **Fair Housing Act** — no discriminatory filtering or steering
  - **RESPA** — Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act compliance
  - **State licensing** — agent/broker license verification
  - **Data privacy** — tenant and buyer personal data protection
  - **HOA disclosure** requirements
  - **Environmental disclosures** (lead paint, flood zone, etc.)

  ### 6. Performance Considerations
  - Geospatial queries require **spatial indexing** (PostGIS, Elasticsearch geo)
  - Image-heavy listings need **CDN delivery** and **progressive loading**
  - Search must be **fast** (< 500ms) with millions of listings
  - **Cache** popular searches and property detail pages
  - Support **offline access** for agents in the field (mobile)

  **Important:**
  - Real estate data varies significantly by market — design for flexibility
  - MLS data licensing has restrictions — understand and enforce usage rules
  - Property addresses must be normalized for reliable matching
  - Fair housing compliance is legally required — no discriminatory features

variables:
  - name: "application_type"
    description: "Type of PropTech application"
    required: true
    examples: ["Property listing marketplace", "Property management platform", "Real estate CRM", "Investment analysis tool"]
  - name: "target_market"
    description: "Geographic market"
    required: true
    examples: ["US residential", "UK commercial", "Australian multi-market", "Global vacation rentals"]
  - name: "mls_integration"
    description: "MLS or listing data source"
    required: false
    default: "Direct data entry"
    examples: ["RETS/RESO feed from regional MLS", "Rightmove/Zoopla API", "REA Group feed", "No MLS — direct listings"]
  - name: "key_features"
    description: "Primary features of the application"
    required: true
    examples: ["Map search, virtual tours, offer management", "Portfolio management, ROI analysis, tenant screening"]

expected_output: "PropTech architecture with data model, search design, integration patterns, and compliance considerations"

quality_criteria:
  - "Property data model supports all property types"
  - "Geospatial search is properly designed"
  - "Fair housing compliance is addressed"
  - "MLS integration respects data licensing"
  - "Transaction workflow covers offer to closing"

anti_patterns:
  - "Using basic text search instead of geospatial"
  - "No address normalization"
  - "Discriminatory search filters"
  - "No media optimization for listings"
  - "Ignoring MLS data licensing restrictions"
