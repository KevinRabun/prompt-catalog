  You are a software architect designing a contract lifecycle management (CLM) platform.

  **Context:**
  - Organization Type: {{organization_type}}
  - Contract Volume: {{contract_volume}}
  - Contract Types: {{contract_types}}
  - Integration Requirements: {{integration_requirements}}
  - Compliance Requirements: {{compliance_requirements}}

  **Design and implement covering these CLM-specific requirements:**

  ### 1. Contract Authoring and Templates
  - **Template library**: version-controlled contract templates with clause libraries
  - **Clause management**: modular, reusable clauses with metadata (risk level, owner, jurisdiction)
  - **Clause alternatives**: pre-approved fallback positions for negotiation
  - **Dynamic assembly**: assemble contracts from template + selected clauses + deal-specific terms
  - **Smart fields**: auto-populate from CRM, ERP, or deal data (parties, dates, amounts, terms)
  - **Playbook integration**: embed negotiation guidelines directly in the authoring workflow
  - **Conditional logic**: clauses included/excluded based on deal attributes (value, jurisdiction, risk)
  - **Output formats**: Word (track-changes compatible), PDF, HTML for review portals

  ### 2. Negotiation and Collaboration
  - **Redlining / track changes**: real-time or turn-based document editing with change tracking
  - **Version comparison**: visual diff between any two versions of a contract
  - **Internal vs. external collaboration**: separate views for internal comments and counterparty access
  - **Approval workflows**: configurable multi-stage, multi-role approval chains
    - Parallel and sequential approvals
    - Escalation rules (auto-escalate after N days)
    - Delegation and out-of-office handling
    - Conditional approval routing based on deal value, deviation from standard terms
  - **Deviation management**: flag non-standard terms, require justification and elevated approval
  - **Audit trail**: every action, comment, and change logged with user and timestamp
  - **Negotiation analytics**: track negotiation cycles, time-to-sign, common pushback points

  ### 3. Execution and E-Signature
  - **E-signature integration**: DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or qualified electronic signatures (QES)
  - **Signature workflow**: sequential, parallel, or hybrid signing order
  - **Legal validity**: compliance with eIDAS (EU), ESIGN Act / UETA (US), or local regulations
  - **Wet signature handling**: upload and link physical signed documents
  - **Countersignature tracking**: alert when awaiting counterparty signature
  - **Executed document management**: immutable storage of fully executed contracts with metadata

  ### 4. Obligation and Milestone Tracking
  - **Obligation extraction**: identify and catalog obligations from contract text
  - **Obligation types**: payment obligations, delivery milestones, reporting requirements, SLA commitments, notice periods
  - **Automated reminders**: configurable alerts before obligation deadlines
  - **Obligation ownership**: assign responsible individuals or teams per obligation
  - **Performance tracking**: track obligation fulfillment status with evidence
  - **Penalty / SLA management**: calculate penalties for missed obligations
  - **Calendar integration**: sync key dates (renewals, expirations, notice periods) to calendars

  ### 5. Contract Repository and Search
  - **Central repository**: single source of truth for all contracts
  - **Metadata schema**: standardized contract metadata (parties, type, value, dates, jurisdiction, status)
  - **Full-text search**: search within contract text across the entire repository
  - **AI-powered extraction**: automatically extract key terms, dates, parties, amounts from uploaded contracts
  - **Classification**: auto-categorize contracts by type, department, risk level
  - **Hierarchy**: parent-child relationships (master agreements, amendments, SOWs, change orders)
  - **Access control**: role-based access per contract, department, or classification
  - **Retention and purging**: automated retention policy enforcement with legal hold capability

  ### 6. Renewals and Expirations
  - **Renewal calendar**: dashboard of upcoming renewals and expirations
  - **Auto-renewal management**: flag auto-renewing contracts and their opt-out windows
  - **Renewal workflow**: initiate renewal review process N days before expiration
  - **Amendment tracking**: link amendments and change orders to parent contracts
  - **Termination management**: track termination provisions and notice requirements
  - **Expired contract handling**: archival process for expired/terminated contracts

  ### 7. Reporting and Analytics
  - **Contract portfolio dashboard**: total value, count by status, upcoming expirations
  - **Cycle time analytics**: time from request to execution, by contract type
  - **Risk analysis**: contracts with non-standard terms, unsigned, past-due obligations
  - **Financial reporting**: aggregate contract values, commitment forecasting
  - **Compliance reporting**: audit-ready reports demonstrating policy adherence
  - **Vendor/customer analysis**: contract history, performance, and relationship metrics
  - **Export**: CSV, PDF, and API access for BI tool integration

  ### 8. Integration Architecture
  - **CRM**: Salesforce, Dynamics 365, HubSpot — deal data, account mapping
  - **ERP**: SAP, Oracle, NetSuite — purchase orders, financial commitments
  - **Procurement**: Coupa, Ariba — supplier contracts, RFP/RFQ linkage
  - **Document management**: SharePoint, Google Drive — external document storage
  - **Identity**: SSO (SAML, OIDC), directory integration for user provisioning
  - **API design**: RESTful APIs for all core operations, webhooks for events
  - **Data migration**: import existing contracts with metadata and OCR for legacy documents

  **IMPORTANT CAVEATS:**
  - This is a technical architecture guide — contract terms and legal language require legal counsel
  - E-signature legal validity varies by jurisdiction — verify local requirements
  - AI-powered clause extraction should include confidence scores and human review
  - Retention policies must align with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements

  **Deliver:**
  1. CLM platform architecture with module decomposition
  2. Contract authoring and template management design
  3. Workflow engine specification (negotiation, approval, execution)
  4. Obligation tracking data model and alerting strategy
  5. Integration architecture with CRM/ERP/procurement systems
  6. Repository design with search, access control, and retention management

  - "Obligation tracking provides proactive alerts before deadlines"
  - "Repository search covers both metadata and full-text content"
  - "Integration design provides bidirectional data flow with core business systems"
